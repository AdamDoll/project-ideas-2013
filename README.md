Project Ideas for this years Cyber Defense club



Goals
=====
Our goals for the CDC this year are to get MORE people involved and working throughout the year, 
not just a few throughout the year and everyone hops on board around crunch time.

In the past we have tried to do this (mostly unsuccessfully). It was still the core members working on all sorts 
of things and newer members anot participating. This is probably because joining and getting involved is 
intimidating and newer members just don't know where to start.

To combat this, we are re-structuring the way the club works. Instead of this being mostly individual,
I want to try groups. Also, instead of the projects being very small, I want to the projects to be bigger, better, 
and more motivating.

1. More contributions, especially from newer members.
2. Encourage group collaboration.
3. Interact with alumni who have expertise on related projects and seek guidance.
4. Work on a variety of computer related projects and build/do things that members can put on a resume.

Ideas
=====

These ideas are just things I've thought of in about 2 minutes of real thinking. If you have an idea then get a group
and begin working. Add it to the `projects.txt`
